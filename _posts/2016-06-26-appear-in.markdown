We now have [a room](http://appear.in/wlc) on Appear.in for remote hangouts, please join the room to make sure it works and (if you want to) switch notifications on so you'll be notified when someone joins the room. There's an app for it.

We'll trial this on Saturday for anyone who wants to join remotely, but being Costa and given we'll all be talking at once this may not be the easiest experience. That said if we break into pairs/groups then some of us may want to collaborate.

Maybe we could also give ScreenHero a go. I've also just realised we need comments on this site so people can actually respond to what I'm saying. So that's going on the list.
