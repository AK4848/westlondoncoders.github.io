Today we had our first meetup away from Costa and it was joyous! Jerome (@Jayzillachu) secured the venue with YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP and it's a fantastic space.

For the first time we were able to hear each other! So this was the first meetup where we actually managed to have several people committing to the same [repo](https://github.com/WestLondonCoders/onyx/commits/master), and we built a [Rails app of portfolio pages](https://wlc-onyx.herokuapp.com/).

Now that we've had a chance to focus on something as a group, we've got a better idea of how we can co-ordinate moving forward, and we'd like to have more freedom to work on one or more projects at the same time so there's something for everyone.

We'd also like to join a hangout so others can join remotely, which is now possible thanks to our new venue.

Please do send me feedback about today, and any ideas you might have about how we can operate in the future.
