We're now just over two weeks away from our meetup at Sky, who are hosting us at their Osterly campus with food, drinks and a couple of fantastic talks!

Sky's senior JavaScript developer Andy Bryant will be giving us an intro to functional programming, examining how to program in a functional style using ES6+. He'll discuss what functional programming means, its benefits, methodology, and techniques.

Scott Guymer, Sky's principal engineer from their Digital Hub in Leeds, will also be talking to us about continuous deployment.

After the talks there'll be time to socialise, network, chat about coding and experience a bit of what it's like on the inside at Sky HQ.

It's not too late to [RSVP for the meetup](https://www.meetup.com/West-London-Coders/events/233085459/), and directions can be found on the [event page](https://www.meetup.com/West-London-Coders/).

You can also RSVP to any of our regular fortnightly Saturday meetups1 at YOOX NET-A-PORTER at midday where we hang out and build cool things.
